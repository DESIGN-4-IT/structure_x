Subject: Request for Half-Day Leave Due to Personal Reasons

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that I will need to take a half-day off today ([date]) due to some personal work that requires my attention. I will complete my tasks as much as possible before leaving and ensure a smooth handover for any pending items.

Please let me know if you need any information or if there are any urgent tasks that I should prioritize before I leave.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
