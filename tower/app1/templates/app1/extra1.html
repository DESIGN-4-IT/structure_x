2. Select Set Max Resultant (Within Groups)

Functionality:
Selects the record with the highest Resultant value for each Set No., within each group.

Behavior:
Inside every group, for each unique Set No., it selects only one record, which has the maximum Resultant value for that Set.

Example (based on our data):

Custom Group: hurri1
It has records for Set 9 and Set 10 
1 max record from Set 9 and 1 max record from Set 10 (total 2 records).

Custom Group: NESC1
It also has records for Set 9 and Set 10 
1 max record from each set (total 2 records).

✔ Total selected = 4 records (2 from hurri1 + 2 from NESC1)

then we have 

Group-wise Calculations (Separate Addition)

Here the system performs separate summation for each group.
Each group’s two max-resultant records are summed individually.

see this is hurri1 2 set max records 
and then sum of this records highlighted here 
hurri1 4 records Group Sum	1341.00	47.00	-7565.00	7683.08

same for NESC1 

then after summation, we apply buffer operation on each group’s Original Sum.
so this is Original Sum of Custom Group: hurri1
same below also we have this original sum of vert ,tran and long in Group-wise Calculations (Separate Addition): section 
 so now we Apply Buffer to This Group Hurri1 
Sum of Vertical Loads:
1341.00 lbs
Sum of Transverse Loads:
47.00 lbs
Sum of Longitudinal Loads:
-7565.00 lbs
Resultant Load:
7683.08 lbs

This gives the Processed (Buffered) Sum for each group.


Buffered / Processed Values Example
Group	Vert	Transverse	Longitudinal
hurri1	1500.00	200.00	-7700.00
NESC1	1600.00	-200.00	-12900.00
Using Group-wise Processed Sum in Load Conditions Page

When we click Configure Load Conditions, we move to the Load Conditions page.
Here, we display the values from Group-wise Set Max Resultant Calculations.

Displayed Data Example:

Group: hurri1

Base Vert: 1500.00 lbs

Base Trans: 200.00 lbs

Base Long: -7700.00 lbs

Base Resultant: 7847.29 lbs

Group: NESC1

Base Vert: 1600.00 lbs

Base Trans: -200.00 lbs

Base Long: -12900.00 lbs

Base Resultant: 13000.38 lbs

Applying Factored Loads

Next, we apply Factored Loads (e.g., NESC LIGHT 250B Load Factors) separately for each group.

Example for Group: hurri1

Vert: 1500 × 1.5 = 2250.00

Same calculation is done for Trans and Long.

Similarly, for Group: NESC1, we apply the same load condition factors to its processed values, independently.
